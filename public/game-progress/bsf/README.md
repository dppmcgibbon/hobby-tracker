# Blackstone Fortress assets

Copy your existing BSF PHP app assets here so images and PDFs work:

- **images/** – from your `bsf/images/` folder (tokens, explorers, cards, ships, stronghold, gameplay)
- **pdfs/** – from your `bsf/pdfs/` folder (rulebook PDFs)

Example:

```bash
cp -r /path/to/bsf/images public/game-progress/bsf/
cp -r /path/to/bsf/pdfs public/game-progress/bsf/
```
